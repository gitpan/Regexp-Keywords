Regexp-Keywords

A regexp builder to test against keywords lists.

This module helps you to search inside a list of keywords for some
of them, using a simple query syntax with AND, OR and NOT operators
and grouping.

    use Regexp::Keywords;
    my $kw = Regexp::Keywords->new();
    
    my $wanted = 'comedy + ( action , romance ) - thriller';
    $kw->prepare($wanted);
    
    my $movie_tags = 'action,comedy,crime,fantasy,adventure';
    print "Buy ticket!\n" if $kw->test($movie_tags);

Keywords, also known as tags, are used to classify things in a
category. Many tags can be assigned at the same time to an item,
even if they belong to different available categories.
